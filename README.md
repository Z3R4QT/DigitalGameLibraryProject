Digital Game Library Project

Introduction

The Digital Game Library Project is an application designed to help users manage and organize their collection of digital games. 
It allows users to store important information about each game, such as its title, genre, platform, and other relevant details, all in one place for easy access and management.
This project was created to practice fundamental programming concepts, including database integration and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. 
By using this system, users can efficiently add new games, view their collection, update game information, or remove games they no longer want to track.
The Digital Game Library Project is beginner-friendly, demonstrating how a simple digital library can be built and managed effectively. 
It provides hands-on experience in developing functional applications while emphasizing organized data management, making it a practical learning tool for anyone starting in programming.
